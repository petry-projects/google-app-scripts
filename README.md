| **Gmail to Drive By Labels** | Automatically archives emails from specific Gmail labels into a Google Doc (text) and Google Drive Folder (attachments). Features robust text cleaning (removing quoted replies/legal footers) and smart content-based attachment de-duplication. | [View Readme](./src/gmail-to-drive-by-labels/README.md) |
| **Calendar to Sheets**       | Syncs Google Calendar events into a Google Sheet, keeping rows up to date on changes and deletions.                                                                                                                                               | [View Readme](./src/calendar-to-sheets/README.md)       |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option A — Browser-based deployment (recommended)

Deploy and configure any script directly from your browser — no command line or manual ID-hunting required.

1. **Open the deployment page** — `deploy/index.html` (or the hosted GitHub Pages version if available).
2. **Review authentication details** — the deployment page uses a preconfigured OAuth Client ID defined in `deploy/index.html`. If you are using this repository as-is, you do not need to create or enter your own client ID. If you fork this repo and want to use your own, see the GCP setup section below and [deploy/index.html](./deploy/index.html) for details.
3. **Sign in with Google** — authorise the page to create Apps Script projects and read your Gmail labels, calendars, and Drive resources on your behalf.
4. **Select a script and click Deploy** — the page fetches the latest source files from this repository, uploads them to your account, and creates a new Apps Script project with an auto-generated name. A direct link to the new project is shown on success.
5. **Configure your script (Step 4)** — after deployment a **Configure** panel appears automatically for each deployed script. Use the dropdowns and Drive Pickers to select your resources (Gmail labels, calendars, Google Docs, Drive folders/spreadsheets), then click **Save Configuration**. This writes the settings directly to your Apps Script project's `config.gs` — no manual editing required.

### Option B — Manual copy-paste

1.  **Browse the Catalog:** Check the table above to find a script that fits your needs.
2.  **Open the Folder:** Navigate to the specific script folder (e.g., `/src/gmail-to-drive-by-labels`).
3.  **Code & Config Convention:** Each script places the runnable code in `code.gs` and configuration values in `config.gs`.
4.  **Copy the Code:** Open `code.gs` (and `config.gs`) in the folder and copy them into a new [Google Apps Script project](https://script.google.com/).
5.  **Configure:** Update `config.gs` values (spreadsheet id, sheet name, etc.) and follow the specific setup instructions in that script's `README.md`.

## ⚙️ One-Time GCP Setup (For Fork Maintainers)

If you fork this repository and want to use the browser-based deployment page or the GAS Installer Web App, you must manually configure your Google Cloud Platform project once before anything will work.

### Step 1: Enable Required APIs

1. Go to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Library** and enable the following APIs:

   | API                        | Used for                                                                         |
   | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Google Apps Script API** | Creating and updating Apps Script projects (deploy steps 1–3)                    |
   | **Gmail API**              | Populating Gmail label dropdowns in Step 4 (configure)                           |
   | **Google Calendar API**    | Populating calendar dropdowns in Step 4 (configure)                              |
   | **Google Drive API**       | Drive Picker for selecting Docs, folders, and spreadsheets in Step 4 (configure) |

### Step 2: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**. Set it to **External** (so anyone can use it).
2. Add the following OAuth scopes so the page can deploy and configure scripts:

   | Scope                                               | Purpose                                                    |
   | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.projects`   | Create and update Apps Script projects                     |
   | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`    | Drive Picker — browse and select Docs, folders, and sheets |
   | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`      | Read Gmail label names for the config dropdowns            |
   | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` | Read calendar list for the config dropdowns                |

3. Add any test users while your app is in **Testing** mode (you can publish it later if needed).

### Step 3: Create an OAuth Client ID

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**.
3. Choose **Web application**.
4. Under **Authorised JavaScript origins**, add the origin(s) from which you will serve `deploy/index.html` (e.g. `https://<your-username>.github.io` for GitHub Pages, or `http://localhost:<port>` for local testing).
5. Copy the generated **Client ID** and replace the `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` constant in `deploy/index.html`.

### Step 4: (Optional) Link Your GCP Project to the Apps Script Project

Note your **Project Number** from the GCP dashboard. You will enter this into the **Settings → "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project"** section of your Installer GAS project if you are using the GAS Installer web app.
